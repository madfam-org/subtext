<!-- MADFAM-AGENTS-CANONICAL v1 -->

This is the canonical instruction file for Claude, Codex, and any other LLM
agent working in this repository. `CLAUDE.md` is kept only as a compatibility
redirect and should not become the source of truth again.

## Required operating doctrine

- Read this file before making repo changes.
- Prefer existing repo conventions, scripts, and docs over introducing new
  patterns.
- Preserve user work and never revert unrelated changes.
- Treat production operations as Enclii-first: use Enclii web, API, or CLI for
  provisioning, deployment, observability, domains, secrets, provider
  operations, scaling, rollback, and remediation.
- Use direct `kubectl`, `helm`, SSH, provider CLIs/APIs, `docker exec`, or
  direct container access only for platform bootstrap or documented break-glass
  emergencies when Enclii is unavailable or lacks an implemented adapter.
- Record any missing Enclii adapter gap instead of normalizing raw production
  access in docs or runbooks.

## Repo entrypoints

- `README.md`
- `ECOSYSTEM.md`
- `infra/`
- `.github/workflows/`

## LLM context files

- `llms.txt` is the compact context index.
- `llms-full.txt` is the durable full-context map and operating contract.
- `AGENTS.md` is canonical for agent instructions.
- `CLAUDE.md` redirects here for Claude compatibility.
